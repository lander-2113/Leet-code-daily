Given: 	nums (int array)
	n distinct numbers in the range[0, n]

Task::	return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

s1 sort the array
s2 declare i, n as 0 and lenght of array respectively
s3: run loop from i to n
	if the i is not equal to the indexed value in the nums:
		then return i
s5: return n

time nlonn + n

space O(1)


Python code:

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        nums.sort()
        
        i, n = 0, len(nums)
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i != nums[i]:
                return i
        
        return n


algorithtm 2:

s1 start:
s2 fidn the sum of first n natural numbers, using n*(n+1)
s3 find the sum of  numbers of the array
s4 find the differenc of the two sume
s5 return the difference.
s6 end.

code

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        total = (n * (n + 1))//2
        return total - sum(nums)


algorithm 3
bitwise xor solution.

so there is expected XOR that should come when 0 to n numbers are xored.

and there is number that should come when xored the digits of the array.

then xor both of these numbers and return it.

that is the answer.

code.

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        actualXor = n
        expectedXor = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            actualXor ^= nums[i]
            expectedXor ^= i
        
        return actualXor ^ expectedXor
