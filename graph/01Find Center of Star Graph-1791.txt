Setting:	star(undirected) graph
        has n nodes.
        labeled from 1 to n.

A star graph where there is one center node
and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the
center node with every other node.

given:  edges(2D integer array) where each
        each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates
        that there is an edge between the nodes
        ui and vi.

task:   Return the center of the given
        star graph.

how do I find the node that connects with all?

is all the node have only one connection except
the center node?

which only have more one connection?

approach1:
just run a loop from 0 to number of edges
put a condition of i + 1 < edge length

check if the current edge vertex are in the
next edge, i.e i + 1 edge

and return that vertex.

code:
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:


        nedges = len(edges)

        i = 0
        t = -1
        while i + 1 < nedges :

            v = 0
            while v < 3:
                if edges[i][v] in edges[i + 1]:
                    return edges[i][v]
                v += 1

            i += 1

        return -1

complexity:
O(1) as the outer loop only runs only one time.
and the inner loop runs only two time.

approach2
Since, it is a guarantee that there is a common vertex
in every edge.

then we can just compare the vertex.
and return the one that matches.

code:
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:


        if edges[0][0] == edges[1][0] or edges[0][0] == edges[1][1]:
            return edges[0][0]
        return edges[0][1]
